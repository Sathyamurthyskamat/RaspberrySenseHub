# LEDs:

LEDs, or Light-Emitting Diodes, are semiconductor devices that emit light when an electric current passes through them. They are widely used in various applications such as lighting, indicators, and displays due to their efficiency, durability, and low power consumption.

# How LEDs Work?

LEDs work based on a process called electroluminescence. When a voltage is applied across the LED's semiconductor material, electrons and electron holes combine, releasing energy in the form of photons (light). The color of the light emitted depends on the semiconductor material used in the LED.

# Programming LEDs with Python on Raspberry Pi:

Raspberry Pi is a popular single-board computer used for various projects, including controlling LEDs. Python is a beginner-friendly programming language commonly used for Raspberry Pi projects due to its simplicity and versatility.

# Connecting LEDs to Raspberry Pi GPIO:

To physically connect an LED to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, you'll need:

1. An LED
2. A current-limiting resistor (typically around 220/1k ohms)
3. Jumper wires
